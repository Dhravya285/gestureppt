Gesture-Based PPT Controller
This project enables you to control a PowerPoint presentation using hand gestures captured via a webcam. It supports slide navigation, freehand drawing, shape annotations, and cursor control, with the ability to save annotated slides as images and export them as a PDF. The project uses MediaPipe for hand tracking, OpenCV for video processing, and PyAutoGUI for system control.
Features

Slide Navigation: Move to the next slide (3 fingers) or previous slide (4 fingers).
Freehand Drawing: Draw on slides with 1 finger (green pencil brush, adjustable thickness).
Shape Drawing: Draw rectangles or circles (toggle with m and c keys).
Cursor Control: Move the system cursor (1 finger) and click (2 fingers) when in cursor mode (toggle with r).
Save and Export: Save annotated slides as PNGs (s key) and export to PDF (p key).
Clear Canvas: Clear annotations with 5 fingers.

Requirements

Python 3.7+
Dependencies:
opencv-python
mediapipe
pyautogui
Pillow
reportlab
pygetwindow (for PowerPoint focus)


Hardware: Webcam, Windows OS (tested on Windows, may work on macOS with adjustments).
Software: Microsoft PowerPoint (slide show mode).

Installation

Clone or Download:
Download the main.py script or clone the repository.


Install Dependencies:pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui Pillow reportlab pygetwindow


Verify Webcam: Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.
Prepare PowerPoint: Have a presentation ready in slide show mode (F5).

Usage

Run the Script:python main.py

The script will initialize the webcam and display instructions in the terminal:ðŸŽ¨ PPT Annotation + Cursor Control Instructions:
1 Finger â†’ Draw (Shape in shape mode) or Move Cursor (Cursor mode)
2 Fingers â†’ Click (Cursor mode) | 3 Fingers â†’ Next Slide
4 Fingers â†’ Previous Slide / Change Color | 5 Fingers â†’ Clear Canvas
Press M â†’ Toggle Shape Mode | Press C â†’ Switch Rectangle/Circle
Press R â†’ Toggle Cursor Mode | Press T â†’ Test Draw | S â†’ Save Slide | P â†’ Export PDF | Q â†’ Quit


Open PowerPoint:
Start your presentation in slide show mode (F5) and maximize the window.


Perform Gestures:
Drawing: Show 1 finger (index up, others down) to draw. Ensure cursor mode is off (r to toggle off).
Shapes: Press m to enable shape mode, c to toggle rectangle/circle. Show 1 finger to start, move, hide fingers to finalize.
Cursor Control: Press r to enable cursor mode. Show 1 finger to move cursor, 2 fingers to click.
Navigation: Show 3 fingers for next slide, 4 fingers for previous slide (also changes drawing color).
Clear Canvas: Show 5 fingers to clear annotations.
Save/Export: Press s to save a snapshot, p to export snapshots as PDF.
Test Drawing: Press t to draw a test line to verify rendering.
Quit: Press q to exit.


Monitor Output:
Check the OpenCV window ("PPT Annotation + Cursor Control") for the PowerPoint slide, annotations, and a red cursor dot.
Watch the terminal for debug messages (e.g., Drawing freehand at (x, y), Next slide triggered).



Troubleshooting

Annotations Not Appearing:
Ensure Cursor Mode: OFF (press r).
Show 1 finger clearly (index up, others down) in good lighting.
Press t to test drawing. If no line appears, check OpenCV window rendering.
Verify terminal output shows Fingers up: 1 and Drawing freehand at (x, y).


Slides Not Changing:
Ensure PowerPoint is in slide show mode and focused.
Check for Next slide triggered or Previous slide triggered in terminal.
Manually test right/left keys in PowerPoint to confirm responsiveness.
If PowerPoint window not found appears, ensure PowerPoint is open and maximized.


Cursor Not Moving/Clicking:
Toggle cursor mode with r (Cursor Mode: ON).
Show 1 finger for movement, 2 fingers for clicking. Check for Moving cursor to (x, y) or Clicking at (x, y).


Hand Detection Issues:
Ensure good lighting and hand fully visible in webcam.
Adjust hand orientation (palm facing camera, fingers distinct).


Dependencies:
Install pygetwindow if PowerPoint focus fails (pip install pygetwindow).
Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.



Notes

Canvas: Annotations appear on a white canvas overlaid on the PowerPoint slide in the OpenCV window.
Output: Snapshots are saved in the output/ folder as PNGs, and PDFs are exported there.
Performance: Lower webcam resolution (640x480) is used for better performance. Adjust if needed.
Windows-Specific: The alt+tab focus and pygetwindow are optimized for Windows. macOS users may need to modify focus logic.

Example Terminal Output
Fingers up: 1, Draw coords: (174, 370), Cursor coords: (261, 555)
Drawing freehand at (174, 370)
Fingers up: 3, Draw coords: (554, 501), Cursor coords: (831, 751)
Next slide triggered: Sending keys
Focused PowerPoint window
Fingers up: 2, Draw coords: (462, 262), Cursor coords: (693, 393)
Clicking at (693, 393)
